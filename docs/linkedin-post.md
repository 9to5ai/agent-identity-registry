# LinkedIn Post — Agent Identity Governance

**You can't have AI accountability without AI identity.**

As autonomous agents become common in enterprise systems—spawning sub-agents, crossing API boundaries, making decisions without human-in-the-loop—I kept running into the same problem:

When Agent A spawns Agent B spawns Agent C... who's actually responsible?

Current identity systems can't answer this. API keys don't distinguish between agents. Audit logs show "key X called API Y"—but can't tell you which agent, authorized by whom, took the action.

So I built something.

**Agent Identity Governance** is a framework that provides:
✅ Explicit agent identity (not shared API keys)
✅ Delegation chain tracking (who spawned whom)
✅ Scope attenuation (children can't exceed parent permissions)
✅ Audit trails that trace every action back to human authority

It's not theoretical—I built a working proof-of-concept in a weekend.

The code is open source. The framework is submitted to NIST's AI Accountability consultation.

**Why does this matter?**

Regulations (NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act, APRA CPS 230) all require accountability—but none specify how to identify autonomous agents. This is the missing infrastructure layer.

If you're building AI agents, you'll hit this problem. If you're regulating them, you're already seeing it.

Built this over the weekend: Agent Identity Governance

Problem: When AI Agent A spawns Agent B spawns Agent C... who's responsible?

Solution: Explicit identity, delegation chains, audit trails that trace to human authority.

Open source: github.com/9to5ai/agent-identity-registry
Submitted to NIST.

Feedback welcome.
